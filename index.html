				<h3>Quick reading for everyone</h3>
				<p>Yarn brings you one short story at a time from our collection of classic literature. No choosing, no skipping. All you have to do is read.</p>
				<p>Oh, and let us know what you thought of the story when you're done.</p>

				<h3>Why we made this</h3>
				<p>We&apos;ve made Yarn because we believe in the importance of storytelling. It is our hope that it may contribute in some small way to helping people access literature.</p>
				<h4>One story at a time</h4>
				<p>If your attention span is anything like ours, it's short. There's social media, rolling news and a constant bombardment by ads to contend with. As a result, quickly changing content and contexts has become second-nature. Our hope is that by presenting your with a single story at any one time, the task of choosing is eliminated and the habit of skipping is inhibited; all you have to do is read.</p>
				<h4>Giving our community a personalised experience</h4>
				<p>When you're done with a story you submit a (totally anonymous) preference. This let's us do two things. Firstly, we can use these to improve the experience for everyone in our community of readers by separating the wheat from the chaff. Secondly, in the near-future, we will tailor the stories you recieve to try and balance what you like with the novelty of stories that lie just outside your usual taste.</p>
				<h4>Presented in a format with fewer distractions</h4>
				<p>Our design philosophy, if you can call it that, is to keep things as simple, accessible, and beautiful as possible. Reading should be enjoyable for everyone.</p>
				<h4>Using stories sourced from copyright-free materials</h4>
				<p>People have been writing great literature since humans learnt to encode their stories into symbols. Not long after that, copyright law was invented as a method by which those who wrote popular works could be rewarded.</p> 
				<p>To help prevent the stagnation and monopoly of culture, copyright expires. This means that there is ever more great literature in the public domain. Great efforts are made to bring these works to the masses, through the likes of Project Gutenberg.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Standing on the shoulders of giants, we hope that Yarn will help people to access these works by presenting them in an attractive and captivating format.</p>
